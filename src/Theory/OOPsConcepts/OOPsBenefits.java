        Reusability: OOPs principles like Inheritance, Composition
and polymorphism help in reusing existing code
        Extensibility: Code written using OOPs principles like
Inheritance makes code extensible
        Security: OOPs principles like encapsulation help to keep
the data and the code that operates on the data together and
makes the code secure
        Simplicity: Java classes represent real world objects. This
makes code very easy to understand

     * Q: What are the types of inheritance relationships?
     *
     * A:
     * Inheritance relationships specify how code can be reused. There
     * are two types of inheritance relationships.
     * They are as follows:
     * 1. IS–A
     * An IS–A relationship is implemented via inheritance, that is by
     * creating a sub–class. Assume that, Camera is a subclass and
     * Electronics is a super class. In that case, we can say that,
     * Camera IS–A Electronic product
     * 2. HAS–A
     * A HAS–A relation can be created via composition, that is by
     * creating a field corresponding to another class. Assume that,
     * inside the Camera class, there is an object called Battery. In
     * that case, we can say that Camera HAS–A object called
     * Battery
